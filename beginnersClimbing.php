      			<strong>How it works</strong>
         		<br>The beginners course consists of four, two hour sessions under instruction with all the equipment provided throughout the course.
         		<br>In the first week we cover the basics, putting on your harness, attaching yourself to the rope with a figure of eight and stopper knots and basic belay skills. 
         		<br>In weeks two and three, your basic skills will be developed so you become proficient and able to look after yourself and keep other safe in the climbing wall. 
         		<br>Throughout the course your instructor will also help you with climbing technique so that your ability improves as well as your skills. 
         		<br>The final week is the consolidation week where we will make sure that everything you have learned is polished. We will also advise you what you can do now that you have finished your course. 
         		<br>If you are considering buying any equipment please talk to your instructor and they will be able to give advice on how to select the right equipment.

    			<br><strong>The Cost</strong>
          		<br>The cost of the Beginners course is Â£90.00. This is for the four week course all instruction and all equipment that you will need throughout. As a bonus you can also boulder for the duration (4weeks) of your course free of charge whenever you like.
