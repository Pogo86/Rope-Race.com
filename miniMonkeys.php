          <p>The Mini Monkeys came about due to the massive interest from parents who would like their children into climbing as soon as possible. The Mini Monkey sessions are specially designed for younger climbers focusing on a good warm up and then having fun whilst climbing.
			<br><br><strong>The Sessions</strong>
          <br>We currently have two Mini Monkeys sessions a week, Tuesdays and Fridays from 4:00 - 5:00pm. The sessions are for children aged 5, when they reach the age of 6 they will be ready to join the Geckos Club.

      		<strong>How it works</strong>
         	<br>All our clubs are run by our friendly and experienced rock climbing instructor who will guide them through learning to rock climb whilst having an amazing time.
			The Rope Race junior award scheme will show, teach and encourage every junior climber to learn all aspects of rock climbing including knot tying, belaying and climbing techniques.
         	<br><strong>The Cost</strong>
         	<br>The Mini Monkeys Club is run in blocks of 6 weeks at a cost of Â£54.00, this includes all the instruction and equipment.
			<br>Rock boots can be hired at an additional cost, but are not a essential.
