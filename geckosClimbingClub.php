          <p>The Rope Race Geckos Climbing club is the perfect way to get your kids into rock climbing. We teach kids at any stage in their climbing life, whether it is their first time or are looking to progress
			<br><br><strong>The Sessions</strong>
          <br>Rope Race has 3 Geckos Climbing Club sessions a week, two on a Friday 5:00-7:00 and 7:00- 9:00, and one on a Saturday morning 10:00 - 12:00 noon.
          <br>These sessions are for people between the ages of 6 to 18. The Friday 5-7 session tends to be for 6-11 year-olds and the 11-18's usually come in the 7:00-9:00 session but this is not set in stone and we are flexible.
